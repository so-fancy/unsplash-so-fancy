# Unsplash downloader

This is a simple thrown together library to periodically download unsplash
images into a wallpapers directory. You can then tell macos to cycle through
the directory, using them as wallpaper images.

I'm not using the [official unsplash
library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unsplash) because eh.

The launchctl script will run the unsplash downloader every 6 hours. You should
modify it to suit your preferences. (Actually you should modify the whole
script to suit your preferences).

This library is not maintained. It is put here for convenience. Issues will be
ignored. Fork and modify for yourself.
